**Rough To-Do List**

1. Research more codeing examples as starting points for this project.
   * Find what is useful in the initial code I found and scrap the rest - it has a lot of issues.
   
   * https://github.com/CarleneL/Basic-Budgeting.git
   
1. Create a diagram/map of how I want the program to work and what steps should be included in order.
   * Need to incorporate a system for income taxes by state, social security, and other deductions from income on paystubs.
   * Needs to be as customizable as I can possibly make it.
   
1. Piece together parts of codes to create the program base I would like to begin with.

1. Fine tune the code to do exactly what I mapped out in step two.

1. IMPROVE IT. 





**PROJECT MAPPING**

1. Start the app with asking the user to input their base pay, hourly or salary?

1. Ask their frequency of pay (weekly, biweekly, monthly, etc.)

1. Go to main menu -----
   1. Calculate next paycheck.
      1. How many hours worked
      1. Calculate pay before taxes.
      1. Subtract taxes 
        *11% federal
        *6.2% SS
        *1.45% medicare
        *For now, only calculate Georgia tax rate for state taxes â€“ 4%
      1. Provide final number as a rough estimate
      
   1. Add budget values.
      1. Provide categories to input numbers for.
         *Food
         *Bills
         *Savings
         *Entertainment
         *Personal
         *Other (allow input)
      1. Calculate variance between income and budget
      
   1. Record expenses and revenues.
      1. Allow user to record an expense based on their budget categories.
      
   1. Quit
