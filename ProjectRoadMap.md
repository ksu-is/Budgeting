**Rough To-Do List**

1. Research more codeing examples as starting points for this project.
   * Find what is useful in the initial code I found and scrap the rest - it has a lot of issues.
   
   * https://github.com/CarleneL/Basic-Budgeting.git
   
1. Create a diagram/map of how I want the program to work and what steps should be included in order.
   * Need to incorporate a system for income taxes by state, social security, and other deductions from income on paystubs.
   * Needs to be as customizable as I can possibly make it.
   
1. Piece together parts of codes to create the program base I would like to begin with.

1. Fine tune the code to do exactly what I mapped out in step two.

1. IMPROVE IT.
