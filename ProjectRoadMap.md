**Rough To-Do List**
1. Research more codeing examples as starting points for this project.
   * Find what is useful in the initial code I found and scrap the rest - it has a lot of issues.
   
   * https://github.com/CarleneL/Basic-Budgeting.git
   
   * 11/08/2018 UPDATE - FIREFLY_III:
        
        * Found a VERY complex example of an application built by many people on Github. It incorporates contributions by around 63 people and I believe that this is ideally what I would like to make an application similar to this one. However, this one is too complicated for me at my current level of coding.
        
            *LINK: https://github.com/ksu-is/firefly-iii.git
          
    * 11/13/2018 UPDATE - Another issue:
    
         * Found another example that's closer to what I want to do with this app, but I tried customizing it to what I wanted and it would not work. The code is saved in my budgeting.py file.
   
1. Create a diagram/map of how I want the program to work and what steps should be included in order.
   * Need to incorporate a system for income taxes by state, social security, and other deductions from income on paystubs.
   * Needs to be as customizable as I can possibly make it.
   
   * 11/08/2018 - Created a "Project Format" as seen below. Will probably add more detail as time passes.
   
   
   DONE
   
   
1. Piece together parts of codes to create the program base I would like to begin with.

1. Write some of my own custom code for whatever pieces of the project that I could not borrow from another example. This will probably be most of the code that is found within this project.

1. Fine tune the code to do exactly what I mapped out in step two.

1. IMPROVE IT.

**PROJECT FORMAT**

1. Start the app with asking the user to input their base pay, hourly or salary?

1. Ask their frequency of pay (weekly, biweekly, monthly, etc.)

1. Go to main menu -----
   1. Calculate next paycheck.
      1. How many hours worked
      1. Calculate pay before taxes.
      1. Subtract taxes 
        *11% federal
        *6.2% SS
        *1.45% medicare
        *For now, only calculate Georgia tax rate for state taxes â€“ 4%
      1. Provide final number as a rough estimate
      
   1. Add budget values.
      1. Provide categories to input numbers for.
         *Food
         *Bills
         *Savings
         *Entertainment
         *Personal
         *Other (allow input)
      1. Calculate variance between income and budget
      
   1. Record expenses and revenues.
      1. Allow user to record an expense based on their budget categories.
      
   1. Quit


** UPDATE ON 11/26/2018 **

This roadmap is slightly too complex for my level of experience with Python. :( I have privately been writing and rewriting, testing, and getting frutstrated with the roadmap so I have concluded that I am wanting to be a bit more simple in the program functions.
