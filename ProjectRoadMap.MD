1. Research more codeing examples as starting points for this project.
   * Find what is useful in the initial code I found and scrap the rest.
1. Create a diagram/map of how I want the program to work and what steps should be included in order.
1. Piece together parts of codes to create the program base I would like to begin with.
1. Fine tune the code to do exactly what I mapped out in step two.
1. IMPROVE IT.
